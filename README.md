# OpenVLA fine-tune database generator
The application will generate a database according to the RLDS specification (hopefully!). \
The Kinova ROS node driver, external camera and data are mocked, but can be replaced swiftly if the interfaces are respected.

## Run with mocks
Install the pip dependencies in `requirements.txt` and run `python src/main.py` to generate a mock dataset.
